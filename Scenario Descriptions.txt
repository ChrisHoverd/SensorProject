Scenario 1

Components Used:
Male to Male Wires
Male to Female Wires 
ADC 5 Button Keyboard
8 Pixel Neopixel Stick
Speaker
Photocell Sensor
Sharp IR Distance Sensor
Green LED
Yellow LED
Arduino Uno
Printer Cable
Breadboard

Scenario Description:

This scenario is similar to a driveway light that turns on when it detects a car in the driveway. 
When the distance sensor detects an object that is less than 15cm away from it, it turns on the driveway light (neopixel stick). 
The brightness of the Neopixel stick depends on the amount of light seen by the photocell sensor. If there is little light seen (aka night time), 
the neopixel stick will be at its brightest and vice versa for daytime. Also, when the distance sensor detects an object less than 15cm away, 
it will also play a tone on the speaker thus alerting the homeowner that someone is on the property. There is also a yellow and green LED in 2 
different rooms. A 5 button keyboard with 5 different colours is used. When the green button on the keyboard is pressed, the green LED will turn 
on until the green button is pressed again. The same thing applies to the yellow button. 




Scenario 2

Components Used:

Male to Male Wires
Male to Female Wires 
8 Pixel Neopixel Stick
Speaker
Photocell Sensor
Sharp IR Distance Sensor
Arduino Uno
Printer Cable
Breadboard

Scenario Description:

This scenario is more a traditional alarm system. A distance sensor is attached to the top of the house pointing downwards past the 
3 levels of the house. The distance sensor is able to distinguish the distances between the 3 levels of the house. 
So when an object/person is in the lowest room, the distance sensor will trigger a red flashing light (neopixel stick) and a buzzer with a specific tone. 
When an object/person is in the other 2 levels, the red light will flash also however, the buzzer will play a different tone for each. 
Thus the tone of the buzzer is dependent on how far away the object is from the distance sensor. Thus for each level of the house, 
there is a different tone from the buzzer. The use of the photocell in this scenario is to determine if its night time or day time. 
If itâ€™s daytime, no buzzer or LEDs will flash when an object is detected in any of the levels of the house. 
The buzzer and LEDs will only operate when the photocell determines its night time.
